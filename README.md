## 🚀 About My Project “HackerYou Full‑Stack Dev Project”

My project **HackerYou Full‑Stack Dev Project** is a training web application that I developed as part of the **HackerYou Full‑Stack Development** course.  
It demonstrates the full project lifecycle: from database design and server‑side logic to building a responsive interface and configuring authentication.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

- **End‑to‑end development practice**: I went through every stage — from ER diagrams to UI animations.  
- **Portfolio showcase**: All code is open and documented so potential employers can evaluate my skills.  
- **Modular and scalable architecture**: It’s easy to add new features (chat, payments, admin panel).

## 👥 Who It’s For

- **Full‑Stack students** who want hands‑on experience with a real project.  
- **JS/TS developers** looking to practice React/Next.js and Node.js/Express.  
- **HR and team leads** who need to see my approach to architecture and coding style.

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Backend**:  
  - Node.js + Express  
  - MongoDB (or PostgreSQL)  
  - JWT for authentication  
- **Frontend**:  
  - React (Create React App / Next.js)  
  - Tailwind CSS for styling  
- **Deployment**:  
  - Docker (containerization)  
  - Heroku / Vercel (hosting)

## ⚙️ Features

1. **User registration & login**  
   - Email/password  
   - OAuth (Google/Facebook)  
2. **CRUD operations** on the main entity (e.g., posts, products, tasks)  
3. **Protected endpoints**: only authenticated users can access or modify data  
4. **Reactive UI**: data loads asynchronously without full page reloads  
5. **Form validation** with user-friendly success and error notifications

🔭 My Future Plans
Add a real‑time chat or notifications (Socket.IO)

Integrate a payment system (Stripe/PayPal)

Write end‑to‑end tests (Cypress / Jest + Supertest)

Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions) and deploy on my own VPS
